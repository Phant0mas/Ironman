Ironman-HTTP-Server
===================

The Ironman HTTP server.

Introduction
===================

This is a basic webserver I built, nearly from the ground up, 
so as to help me study both the concept and the implementation of a 
webserver.

Since 24/01/2013 this is a collaborative project belonging to the members of the Linux Users Group of the Technological Educational Institute of Crete.

How to get started
===================

**WARNING! It is necessary to use Linux.**

To get started, clone the repository locally `git clone https://github.com/TEICreteLug/Ironman.git`. Then proceed building the software by issuing `make Ironman`

To test it, simply put some files inside `/var/www` and simply visit `localhost` in your browser.
