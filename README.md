Ironman Web Server
===================

The Ironman Web Server.

Introduction
===================

This is a basic webserver I built, nearly from the ground up, 
so as to help me study both the concept and the implementation of a 
webserver.

Since 24/01/2013 this is a collaborative project belonging to the members of the Linux Users Group of the Technological Educational Institute of Crete.

Aim
=================

The aim of the project is to build a web server, mainly to study the concept, techniques and implementations of web servers, and also to get some C development and network development experience under our belt.

We do not know how far exactly this project will go, or if it will ever reach production level, however, we aim to implement the full HTTP protocol, and also aim for a modular architecture.

How to get started
===================

To get started, clone the repository locally `git clone https://github.com/TEICreteLug/Ironman.git`. Then proceed building the software by issuing `make Ironman`

To test it, simply put some files inside `/var/www` and simply visit `localhost` in your browser.

The license of the software is the GNU/GPL v3, and you can see it attached in the COPYING file.
