TODO:
====================

1. We have to implement the whole HTTP Protocol
2. We have to come up with a form of architecture for the web server
3. Daemonize the server if possible.
4. Enable a debug mode, where functions like dump() should aid in debugging.
5. Implement a logging capability 

NOTE: The above are only ideas. Feel free to contribute your own ideas here.
